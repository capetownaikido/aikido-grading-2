# 1st Kyu and Shodan

1st kyu is really a preparation for shodan. It is 'Shodan Lite'.

By 1st Kyu, I expect the techniques to be second nature. Tom Dijkman Sensei says, “I should be able to wake you up at three in the morning and say, 'Ushiro ryotetori koshinage', and you should do the technique before you're even awake.”

I don't expect to see any struggling or fumbling. This is not to say I expect every technique to work perfectly every time. I do expect that when a technique doesn't work, you investigate from first principles: you don't compromise your posture, you stay soft and responsive, and above all you take the utmost care not to hurt uke.

I expect you to be consolidating the Intermediate Principles and starting to demonstrate the Advanced Principles. There should be inviting, there should be kuzushi, there should be wrapping, and by now you should have confidence in your waza.

Shodan I consider less of a grading and more of a demonstration. Show that you know the basic forms of all the techniques, that you can perform them calmly, softly and cleanly under grading conditions. Show that you can control uke, and care for them.

Shodan is the 'beginner's grade', the stage at which one really begins to study Aikido. Now you know the form of the techniques. Now you start making them your own.

# 2nd Kyu

By 2nd kyu I expect that the waza are becoming routine. There is a new attack, katatori menuchi, and a few other more obscure attacks, but you should be taking these in your stride, using these as a platform to explore and demonstrate that you listen to uke, respond to their attack, and lead them into the waza you want to form without pushing or fighting.

In 2nd kyu, consolidate the Intermediate Principles.

Your ukemi should be looking good. You are presenting tori with a direct and determined attack that isn't hard, but that is continuous. When you are thrown, or taken into a lock, you maintain the connection with tori, and keep that throughout the practice. You are gentle but responsive, able to lead a beginner through a waza, but also able to challenge a senior student without forcing anything.

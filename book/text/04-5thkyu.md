# 5th Kyu

In 5th Kyu, I still want to see all the principles of 6th kyu. This holds true for every level – build upon and improve what has come before.

I also want to see that you are not resorting to strength, but rather using softness and relaxation to make the techniques happen. I want to see an increased attentiveness to your partner. While in 6th kyu I'm happy just to see movement and following tori, at 5th kyu and 4th kyu, I really want to see that you are working on ukemi, that you are listening to your partner, sensing what they are doing, and responding to their movement.

In the techniques of 5th kyu, there are 3 broad themes that I want to see in your practice. The idea of omote (inside) and ura (outside) is really important. Especially with the gyakuhanmi waza, there are distinctions in how the waza begins, where your body moves and how you move uke. At 5th kyu I want to see that you are thinking about these differences, about how they feel, both as tori and as uke.

Shomenuchi is the new attack for 5th kyu, and I want to see that you are doing it clearly, that it is an effective strike, done softly, with care and attention to your partner.

The 3rd big item in 5th kyu is suwariwaza. What I look for in suwariwaza is comfort. You are establishing a basis for suwariwaza that you will be practicing for the rest of your life, so you need to discover a way to do this that is comfortable and natural. Therefore, when you are practicing these techniques, continually ask yourself how you might feel more comfortable doing this.

Watch your posture very carefully. Because you are lower, it is easier to balance, but it is also more difficult to regain your balance.

In all suwariwaza – in fact in everything – do not emphasize speed. Work on the quality of the movement. Is it free, is it soft, are you relaxed?
